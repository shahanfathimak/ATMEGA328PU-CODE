üîß What is HW-316 (4-Channel Relay Module)?
The HW-316 is a 4-channel relay module used to control high-voltage AC devices (like bulbs, fans, etc.) using a low-voltage microcontroller like Arduino.

Each relay acts as an electrically controlled switch. You send a signal from Arduino (LOW or HIGH), and the relay either connects or disconnects the high-voltage circuit.

üì¶ Specifications
Feature	Value
Operating Voltage	5V DC
Channels	4
Relay Type	Electromechanical (SPDT)
Max Load	AC 250V 10A, DC 30V 10A
Trigger Mode	LOW-level trigger (active LOW)
Optocoupler	Yes (for isolation)
Indicator LEDs	Yes (for each relay channel)

üßÉ Pin Description (HW-316)
üü¶ Control Side (DC, Low-voltage side):
Pin	Description
VCC	5V from Arduino
GND	Ground from Arduino
IN1 to IN4	Relay control inputs (LOW to activate)

üî¥ Load Side (AC/High-voltage side):
Each relay has:

COM (Common)

NO (Normally Open)

NC (Normally Closed)

Wiring Example for One Channel:

Bulb ON when relay is triggered: Use COM and NO

Bulb OFF when relay is triggered: Use COM and NC

üíª Simple Code Example
This turns on and off each relay one after the other with 1-second delay.

cpp
Copy
Edit
#define RELAY1 7
#define RELAY2 6
#define RELAY3 5
#define RELAY4 4

void setup() {
  pinMode(RELAY1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(RELAY2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(RELAY3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(RELAY4, OUTPUT);

  // Turn off all relays initially (HIGH = OFF for active LOW)
  digitalWrite(RELAY1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(RELAY2, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(RELAY3, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(RELAY4, HIGH);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(RELAY1, LOW); // Turn ON Relay 1
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(RELAY1, HIGH); // OFF

  digitalWrite(RELAY2, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(RELAY2, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(RELAY3, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(RELAY3, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(RELAY4, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(RELAY4, HIGH);
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Tips
Never touch the AC side while powered!

Double-check all wiring before powering with AC.

Use a fuse or circuit breaker for added protection.

üß† Summary
HW-316 is a 4-channel relay module (5V)

Allows control of high-voltage devices with Arduino

Active LOW: relay turns ON when input pin is set LOW

VCC = 5V, GND = Arduino GND, IN1‚ÄìIN4 = digital pins

Use COM-NO terminals for typical ON/OFF control
