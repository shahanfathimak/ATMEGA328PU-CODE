âœ… PIR Sensor â€“ Simple Note
ðŸ”· What is a PIR Sensor?
PIR stands for Passive Infrared.

It detects motion by sensing infrared radiation (heat) from humans or animals.

It does not emit anything; it only detects.

ðŸ”· How It Works
Every living body emits infrared (IR) radiation.

The PIR sensor has two slots inside. When a person moves in front of it:

One slot senses more IR than the other.

This change triggers the output pin to go HIGH.

connection to Arduino UNO:
vcc(left)->5v
out(middle)->Digital pin
GND(right)->GND

Code:
void setup() {
pinMode(2,INPUT);
Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  int x=digitalRead(2);
  if(x==1){
  Serial.println("Motion detected");
  }
  else{
      Serial.println("Motion not detected");
  }
  delay(500);
}
